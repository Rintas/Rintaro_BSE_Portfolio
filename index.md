# Robotic Arm 60-degrees Of Freedom
The project working/worked on was a robotic arm with claw moved by  4 servos which could all be controlled through 4 potentiometers. By getting the robot to operate correctly I started to see some problems I could fix through future modifications such as the design of the claw, and the ability to control the arm with more ease from distance. This portfolio will explore the development of my robotic arm as I start adding modification and recording milestones.

# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

# First Milestone
The First milestone was assembling the robotic arm and applying code in order to be controlled using the 4 potentiometers. 
- The Robotic arm consists of 4 servo motors that allows the arm to be moved in almost all directions. One located on the base of the arm for direction changes, one located above the base for adjusting the hieght of the overall arm, one behind the claw for adjusting the specific location of the claw, and finally the one that controls the opening/closing of the claw. In terms of mechanical probelms and obstacles I faced was getting the servos to move properly, at first none of the 4 servos moved correctly. I looked in to specific portions of the code looking for any mistakes or changes in numbers but I ultimately found the solution in the build itself. By reinserting the servos in different angles I was able to fix the degree and directions servos moved in. Through playing with the functional arm I found two problems I wated to fix in the future milestones. First one being changing the claw, the original claw only allowed certain shapes to be picked up. Since claws have straight surface it 
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
